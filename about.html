					<p><h2>About Nick Qualls</h2>Nick Qualls grew up in Oklahoma, but he always knew he wanted more out of life. He was inspired to pursue his current path and career by looking for money, a better chance to grow in a company and provide for his family. He had always been a hard worker and wanted to make sure that he could give his family everything they needed and more.
Nick had many hobbies that he enjoyed, including playing golf, football, and baseball, as well as collecting cards and fishing. His most prized possession was a Mickey Mantle Rookie card, which he cherished and kept safe.
At 22, Nick took a bold risk and moved to Kansas City with no plan and no job. He did this to be with his girlfriend, who two months later decided to go to Texas for college. Despite this setback, Nick persevered, dedicating himself to being the best worker he could be and maintaining a long-distance relationship with his girlfriend. This experience taught him the importance of being his own person and not letting others define him.
Nick's dedication and hard work paid off, and he eventually met his wife, who he had initially moved to Kansas City to be with. They now have lovely twin girls, and Nick is determined to do whatever he can to make sure they have the best life possible.
Nick has had to make some difficult decisions in his life, including leaving his job of 6 years as a manager. He realized that his job was affecting his relationship with his wife, and he knew he had to make a change.
Through it all, Nick's biggest influence has been his dad, who taught him the importance of hard work, drive, and dedication. Nick watched his dad work as a door-to-door salesman, getting rejected time and time again, but never letting it get him down. He also saw how his dad supported their family and allowed his stepmom to work at home when there were 7 kids at home.
Nick's goal is to grow into a management role, not because of who he knows, but because of who he is. He wants to live his life with integrity and always do the right thing, just like his dad.
